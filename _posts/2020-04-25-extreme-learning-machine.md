Extreme learning machine (ELM) is a supervised learning framework that simplifies the training process of Single Hidden Layer Feedforward Neural Networks (SLFN). This framework was proposed by [Huang](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/egbhuang/ "Extreme learning machine") to provide better generalization performance at extremely fast learning speed. It has been exhaustively proved that multilayer perceptron (MLP) networks with only one hidden layer can, sufficiently, approximate any continuous function giving origin to SLFNs, however, this does not guarantee optimal learning time, and generalization capabilities, and ease of implementation. SLFNs are  composed of  three separate layers as shown in figure below.

The input layer is the a set of  m independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) pattern data represented by source nodes. The hidden layer is a set of n nodes where a nonlinear transform is applied to the weighted sum of the input layer data. At the output layer another weighted sum is applied, and usually this weights are updated during training as well.   

Compared to SLFN-ELM, traditional supervised learning methods have shown that learning speed of feedforward networks are slower than required. Most of this traditional methods are either gradient based (e.g. backpropagation algortihm) or evolutionary algorithms. The former, could be approached as unrestricted nonlinear optimization problem; where the bottleneck lies on the existence of several local minima, with the underlying assumption of multi-modal nature of the loss function; the latter are rather global optimization problems inspired by biological evolution.

ELMâ€™s learning algorithm randomly chooses and fixes the weights between input and hidden layer, and then analytically determines the weights of the output layer via Least mean squares (LMS) estimators. The fact that the ELM has few parameters to be tuned lead to excel generalization capabilities. The supervised training is occurs as follows:

The SLFN-ELM could be interpreted as linear system

```python
def sigmoid(self, x):
        return 1/(1 + np.exp(-x))
```

```python
  def train(self, Xt, Yd, nh):
        '''
        X_t: Input pattern
        Y_d: Label
        n_h: Hidden nodes
        '''
        # # Fixing random state for reproducibility
        # np.random.seed(7)
        ne = len(Xt[0])
        N = len(Yd)    
        Xt = np.concatenate((Xt, np.ones((N, 1))), axis=1)
        # divide by 10 in order to improve convergence
        W = np.random.rand(ne + 1, nh)/10
        Hi = np.dot(Xt, W)
        H = self.sigmoid(Hi)        
        Bi = np.dot(np.linalg.pinv(H), Yd)
        
        return W, Bi
```

```python

    def predict(self, Xt, W, B):
        '''
        ELM test unit for prediction
        X_t: test input pattern
        W_i: Weights vector
        B_i: Bias vector
        '''
        N = len(Xt)
        Xt = np.concatenate((Xt, np.ones((N, 1))), axis=1)
        Hi = np.dot(Xt, W)
        H = 0
        H = self.sigmoid(Hi) 
        Y = np.dot(H, B)
        
        return Y 
```
So first, in order to check the algorithm that we just have implemented, a simple but useful hard test is the exclusive disjunction function or XOR, which is defined as a not linearly separable function. Consider two patterns:

  <img src="{{site.url}}/assets/img/elm/XOR_eq.png"/>
</figure>
Shown in figure bellow is the spatial representation of XOR function for two classes that  cannot be separated in a linear manner.

</figure>
In order to overcome the limitations of linear separabilityit is possible to map this problem in a SLFN with 4 nodes in the hidden layer.

```python
#pattern dataset
X = np.array([[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,1]])
y = np.array([[0],[1],[1],[0]])
#Fixing random state for reproducibility
ELM = ELM()
# training step using 4 nodes in the hidden layer
W_i, B_i = ELM.train(X,y,4)
# label prediction using the calculated weigths
ELM.predict(X,W_i,B_i)
```
